## Test React Project

##### This project is my first dive into React. I've been having ideas for more complicated websites, and I think React might help me with what I want to do. As well as being the first attempt at working with React, this will also be a first prototype for a much polished app I want to do in collaboration with a designer to make sure it looks great. I will test here all or most of the features that I want implemented on the final project

### [ TO-DO ]

- [x] Create Card Component
- [x] Render cards on page
- [x] Create component that will create Cards based on DB file
- [x] Render list of cards on page
- [x] Create search bar
- [ ] Generate functionality for search bar
- [ ] Figure out interactivity for cards
- [ ] Create proper DB file to populate the application
- [ ] Simplify Card and open detailed Card when clicked
- [ ] Group / hide cards depending on revised DB information (???)

### Notes

- converted the application into a class to use states

- tried to add functionality to search box
